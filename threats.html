<h2>The Threats To Bee's</h2>
<p>1. Chemicals were used on commercial crops all across the world after World War II.</p>
<p>2. The balance between pollinators and flowering plants is negatively impacted by climate change, which also raises temperatures and brings about natural disasters. since of this temporal mismatch, honey bees are under nutritional stress since they do not have the necessary resources to flourish. Because honey bees must rely on their honey stores to survive during the winter, many colonies perish every year. The number of deaths will increase, though, if the colonies that do make it are unable to obtain food when foraging</p>
<p>3. Pesticides are a major factor in the annual demise of honey bee colonies and are prohibited in the EU but not in the US. Even though this information is not brand-new, there is not nearly enough urgency to address this issue. The possibility of honey bee extinction will occur far sooner than expected if preventative actions are not implemented. Although they are not the only species in the world that pollinates plants and animals, honey bees are the largest. You may contribute to raising awareness of the current state of honey bees by learning about some of the major threats they face. It will be simpler to improve their lot in life the more people are aware of their situation</p>
<p>4. The construction of new homes and communities generally benefits society. However, as natural spaces diminish in this pursuit, we must note that little is being done to replace land taken by new homes. Much like the lumber industry that conserves their profession by planting more trees than they use, construction companies must adopt the same philosophy when building on plots of land. They could, for example, fund nature sanctuaries and beekeepers to offset the damage of disrupting ecosystems.</p>
